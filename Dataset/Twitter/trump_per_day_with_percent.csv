I like Sen. Grassley s drug pricing bill very much and it s great to see Speaker Pelosi s bill today. Let s get it done in a bipartisan way!,Presidential Harassment!,....Knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially  heavily populated  call.
